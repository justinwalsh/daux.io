Searching in a Daux.io documentation is possible, but only in static mode.

We don't provide this feature in live rendering as it would be too slow.

To enable the generated search, you can set `search` to true in the `html` section of your configuration

```json
{
  "html": {
    "search": true
  }
}
```
